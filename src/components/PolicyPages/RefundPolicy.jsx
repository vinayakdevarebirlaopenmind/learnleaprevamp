          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Non-Refundable Fee:</strong> Upon successful completion of
              the application procedure, participants are required to pay a
              non-refundable course fee. This fee secures your spot in the
              course.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Refund for Personal Reasons:</strong> The course fee is
              non-refundable and will not be returned for personal reasons,
              including but not limited to health issues, family emergencies, or
              any other individual circumstances.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Refund Conditions:</strong> The course fee will only be
              refunded if the course is discontinued for any reason by Birla
              LearnLeap Training Academy.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Absences and Missed Sessions:</strong> Participants who
              miss sessions will not be eligible for a refund for those missed
              classes. Continuing with the course after absences does not
              entitle participants to a refund for any sessions not attended.
              Additionally, if assignments are not submitted, the participant
              will not be eligible for a refund.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Course Completion:</strong> If a participant is unable to
              complete the course for any reason, the paid course fee will be
              forfeited.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Payment Security:</strong> Birla LearnLeap utilizes a
              third-party payment service provider for online transactions.
              While we prioritize security, we cannot guarantee protection
              against unauthorized data use or theft.

              responsible for providing accurate contact information. Birla
              LearnLeap is not liable for any failure to communicate due to
              incorrect or incomplete details.
